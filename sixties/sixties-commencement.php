			University of Iowa Commencement Address by James Michael Moses, May 1970
			</div>
			<p>
Dr. James Michael Moses graduated from the University of Iowa College of Medicine in 1970 and delivered the student address. Earlier in May 1970, in light of campus unrest, the University administration offered students the option to end their semester early or to remain on campus and continue to attend classes, if available.</p>
